I have three models/tabels.

Post, user, comment.

User:
id (Primary Key)
username
password
email


Post:

id (Primary Key)
Title
Content
userId (Foreign Key)

Comment:

id (Primary Key)
Comment
Author
blog_id (Foreign Key)


There is a relation between User and Post. User.hasMany(Post), Post.belongsTo(User). 
There's also a relation between Comment and Post. Post.hasMany(Comment), Comment.belongsTo(Post).
This explains the presence of the foreign keys in the Post and the Comment table.
